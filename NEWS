Package: aroma.cn.eval
======================

Version: 0.5.4 [2019-01-06]

BUG FIXES:

 * aroma.core no longer exports an apply() function.


Version: 0.5.3 [2015-05-04]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package now requires R (>= 3.1.3) released March 2015. This allows
   us to use BioC (>= 3.0) (October 2014).

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Forgot to declare one S3 method in NAMESPACE and
   explicitly import R.utils::GenericSummary.


Version: 0.5.2 [2014-03-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now fitRoc() also returns the number of positives and negatives.

 * Added argument 'as' to fitRoc().

 * Now RocCurve() also accepts a list with element 'roc' and 'cuts'.

PERFORMANCE:

 * Minor speedup by replacing rm() calls with NULL assignments.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added validation of arguments to RocCurve().

BUG FIXES:

 * auc() for RocCurve now adds (FPR,TPR):s (0,0) and (1,1) if missing.


Version: 0.5.1 [2014-03-09]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package requires R (>= 3.0.2) [and Bioc (>= 2.13.0)].
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated package dependencies.


Version: 0.5.0 [2013-12-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added methods for setting up, parsing and extract CN regions -
  methods that were previously only part of the RSP reports code.

 * DOCUMENTATION: Added vignette 'ROC assessment of detecting a change point'

 * DOCUMENTATION: Added help for several more methods.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped function definitions that now are part of the package
  from several internal RSP reports.


Version: 0.4.1 [2013-12-09]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated package dependencies.  Lowered the required version of ROC
  just to get it to build on R-Forge.

 * CLEANUP: Shortened too long (> 100 characters) pathnames of some files.


Version: 0.4.0 [2013-10-28]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package requires R (>= 2.15.0) [and Bioc (>= 2.10.0)].

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated package dependencies.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now importing only what needs to be imported and
  formally declaring all S3 methods in NAMESPACE.

 * CLEANUP: Now scanRocTpAtFp() calls generic function rowWeightedMeans()
  instead of rowWeightedMeans.matrix().

 * CLEANUP: Package no longer depends on R.cache.  Moved several packages
  from 'Depends' to 'Imports'.

 * CLEANUP: Dropped obsolete usage of autoload().


Version: 0.3.3 [2013-09-23]

PERFORMANCE:

 * normalizeTumorBoost() now uses which() instead of whichVector() of
   'R.utils'.  Before R (< 2.11.0), which() used to be 10x slower than
   whichVector(), but now it's 3x faster.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated package dependencies.


Version: 0.3.2 [2012-04-16]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated package dependencies.


Version: 0.3.1 [2012-03-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * PREPARING FOR FUTURE: Updated TCGA vignette to also work when
   RawGenericSignals extends a data.frame, i.e. no longer provides reference
   variables.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: There were some unnecessarily large vignette files.


Version: 0.3.0 [2012-02-26]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added testSeparation() for SegmentedGenomicSignalsInterface. It used to be
   part of the TCGA vignette.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: Now the TCGA vignette utilizes toPNG()/toPDF() of R.utils
   (>= 1.11.0) to generate figures.


Version: 0.2.0 [2011-11-29]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added a namespace.


Version: 0.1.4 [2011-11-29]

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * blockAvg() has been replaced by colAvgsPerRowSet() in the matrixStats
   package.


Version: 0.1.3 [2011-08-01]

BUG FIXES:

 * WORKAROUND: In order for the package to work with the most recent version of
   R devel, which automatically add namespaces to packages who do not have one,
   we explicitly have specify that this package should get function such as
   cat() from R.utils (instead of 'base').


Version: 0.1.2 [2011-03-18]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * VIGNETTES: Updated the TumorBoost vignettes with more help comments and to
   do more sanity checks and give more informative error messages.


Version: 0.1.1 [2009-11-01]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated the dependencies.  For the record, the ROC package is only needed in
   auc() of the RocCurve class.


Version: 0.1.0 [2009-10-02]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated the dependencies.


Version: 0.0.5 [2009-06-10]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now all ROC functions are implemented for SegmentedGenomicSignalsInterface.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Removed ROC functions for SegmentedCopyNumbers.


Version: 0.0.4 [2009-06-04]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Removed obsolete dependency on the R.basic package.


Version: 0.0.3 [2009-02-09]

 * ...
 

Version: 0.0.2 [2009-02-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added ...

 * Added internal fitRoc() and findRocTpAtFp() with Rdoc and examples.


Version: 0.0.1 [2009-01-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Created by compiling several generations of scripts for evaluating raw
   copy-number estimates, e.g. CNAG, CNAT4, CRMA, CRMAv2, dChip.

 * Created.
